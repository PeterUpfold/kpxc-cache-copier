# kpxc-cache-copier

Copy a `.config/keepass-cache.ini` file to `.cache/keepassxc/keepassxc.ini` using only x86-64 assembly and Linux syscalls.

## Why?

In the pursuit of the ultimate geek cred and extraordinary minimalism. Also, what better way to understand assembly, perhaps
in a reverse engineering context, than by forward engineering in it?

Isn't it just so cool to not rely on any library code and call syscalls directly?
